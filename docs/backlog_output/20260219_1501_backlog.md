### Task 1: Implement schema validation in PySpark to prevent corrupt Parquet files

**User Story**

```gherkin
Feature: Schema Validation in PySpark
  As a data engineer,
  I want PySpark to validate the schema of input data before writing it to Parquet files,
  So that I can prevent corrupt Parquet files and ensure data integrity.

Scenario: Validate Input Data Schema
Given a SparkSession with a valid configuration
And a dataset with a well-defined schema
When the dataset is written to a Parquet file using PySpark's write functionality
Then PySpark should validate the input data schema against the expected schema
And raise an error if the schemas do not match.
```

### Task 2: Add a 'What-If' parameter for inflation adjustments in the Power BI report

**User Story**

```gherkin
Feature: Inflation Adjustments in Power BI Report
  As a data analyst,
  I want to be able to adjust inflation rates in the Power BI report using a 'What-If' parameter,
  So that I can explore different scenarios and make more informed decisions.

Scenario: Add Inflation Adjustment Parameter
Given a Power BI report with a financial dataset
When the user selects a new inflation rate from the 'What-If' parameter
Then the report should automatically update to reflect the adjusted values.
```

### Task 3: Optimize Spark shuffle partitions for better local performance on large datasets

**User Story**

```gherkin
Feature: Optimized Spark Shuffle Partitions
  As a data engineer,
  I want to optimize the number of Spark shuffle partitions for large datasets,
  So that I can improve local performance and reduce computation time.

Scenario: Optimize Shuffle Partitions
Given a SparkSession with a valid configuration
And a large dataset with a well-defined schema
When the user specifies an optimal number of shuffle partitions
Then PySpark should adjust the partition count accordingly.
```
