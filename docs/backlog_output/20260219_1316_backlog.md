Let's get started with creating the prioritized backlog. Here are the three tasks you provided:

**Task 1: Implement schema validation in PySpark to prevent corrupt Parquet files**

* User Story:
```gherkin
Given a PySpark DataFrame
When I use the `validate_schema` function to check for schema corruption
Then no errors should be thrown, and the DataFrame should be validated successfully
```
RICE components:

| Component | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reach (R) | 0.8 |
| Impact (I) | 9 |
| Confidence (C) | 0.9 |
| Effort (E) | 40 |

Calculation: RICE = (0.8 * 9 * 0.9) / 40 ≈ 1.56

**Task 2: Add a 'What-If' parameter for inflation adjustments in the Power BI report**

* User Story:
```gherkin
Given a Power BI report with financial data
When I select a specific 'What-If' scenario for inflation adjustment
Then the report should display adjusted values based on the selected scenario
```
RICE components:

| Component | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reach (R) | 0.6 |
| Impact (I) | 8 |
| Confidence (C) | 0.85 |
| Effort (E) | 30 |

Calculation: RICE = (0.6 * 8 * 0.85) / 30 ≈ 1.43

**Task 3: Optimize Spark shuffle partitions for better local performance on large datasets**

* User Story:
```gherkin
Given a large PySpark DataFrame with many partitions
When I configure the optimal number of shuffle partitions based on the cluster size
Then the job should complete faster, and memory usage should be reduced
```
RICE components:

| Component | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reach (R) | 0.9 |
| Impact (I) | 10 |
| Confidence (C) | 0.95 |
| Effort (E) | 50 |

Calculation: RICE = (0.9 * 10 * 0.95) / 50 ≈ 1.73

Here is the prioritized backlog in Markdown table format:

| Priority | Task Name | RICE Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| High | Optimize Spark shuffle partitions for better local performance on large datasets | 1.73 |
| Medium-High | Implement schema validation in PySpark to prevent corrupt Parquet files | 1.56 |
| Medium-Low | Add a 'What-If' parameter for inflation adjustments in the Power BI report | 1.43 |

Note that I've assumed some values for RICE components, which you can adjust based on your specific requirements and estimates. The table is sorted by Score DESCENDING as per the rules.
