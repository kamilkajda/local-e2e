Let's prioritize the provided USER IDEAS and create a PRIORITIZED BACKLOG in a Markdown Table.

**Prioritized Backlog:**

| Priority | Task Name | R | I | C | E | FINAL SCORE |
|----------|-----------|---|---|---|---|-------------|
| High     | Optimize Spark shuffle partitions for better local performance on large datasets. | 0.8 | 0.9 | 0.95 | 80 | 57.76      |
| Medium   | Implement schema validation in PySpark to prevent corrupt Parquet files.          | 0.7 | 0.85 | 0.90 | 60 | 37.29      |
| Low      | Add a 'What-If' parameter for inflation adjustments in the Power BI report.        | 0.5 | 0.75 | 0.80 | 40 | 15.00      |

**RICE Calculations:**

1. **Optimize Spark shuffle partitions for better local performance on large datasets.**
	* Reach (R): 0.8
	* Impact (I): 0.9
	* Confidence (C): 0.95
	* Effort (E): 80 hours
	* FINAL SCORE: (0.8 * 0.9 * 0.95) / 80 = 57.76

2. **Implement schema validation in PySpark to prevent corrupt Parquet files.**
	* Reach (R): 0.7
	* Impact (I): 0.85
	* Confidence (C): 0.90
	* Effort (E): 60 hours
	* FINAL SCORE: (0.7 * 0.85 * 0.90) / 60 = 37.29

3. **Add a 'What-If' parameter for inflation adjustments in the Power BI report.**
	* Reach (R): 0.5
	* Impact (I): 0.75
	* Confidence (C): 0.80
	* Effort (E): 40 hours
	* FINAL SCORE: (0.5 * 0.75 * 0.80) / 40 = 15.00

The prioritized backlog is sorted by Score in DESCENDING order, with the highest-scored task being Optimize Spark shuffle partitions for better local performance on large datasets.

**User Stories in Gherkin format:**

### Optimize Spark shuffle partitions for better local performance on large datasets.
```gherkin
Feature: Optimizing Spark Shuffle Partitions
  As a data engineer
  I want to optimize Spark shuffle partitions for better local performance on large datasets
  So that our data processing tasks can run faster and more efficiently

Scenario: Verify optimized Spark shuffle partitions
  Given a Spark application with a large dataset
  When we configure the spark.shuffle.partitions property to an optimal value
  Then the Spark job should complete within a reasonable time frame (e.g., under 1 hour)
```

### Implement schema validation in PySpark to prevent corrupt Parquet files.
```gherkin
Feature: Schema Validation in PySpark
  As a data engineer
  I want to implement schema validation in PySpark to prevent corrupt Parquet files
  So that our data processing tasks can produce accurate and reliable results

Scenario: Verify schema validation in PySpark
  Given a Spark application with a DataFrame containing invalid Parquet metadata
  When we enable schema validation using the `validateSchema` option
  Then the Spark job should raise an error indicating the schema mismatch (e.g., "Invalid Parquet file schema")
```

### Add a 'What-If' parameter for inflation adjustments in the Power BI report.
```gherkin
Feature: Inflation Adjustments in Power BI Report
  As a business analyst
  I want to add a 'What-If' parameter for inflation adjustments in the Power BI report
  So that our stakeholders can easily explore different inflation scenarios and make more informed decisions

Scenario: Verify 'What-If' parameter in Power BI report
  Given a Power BI report with an inflation-adjusted metric (e.g., revenue)
  When we add a 'What-If' parameter for inflation adjustments (e.g., annual inflation rate)
  Then the report should display the adjusted values based on the selected inflation scenario (e.g., "Revenue: $X million, Inflation-Adjusted")
