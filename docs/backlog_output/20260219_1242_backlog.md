Based on the project context, observations, and suggestions, I will generate a RICE-scored backlog of tasks with precise math calculations.

**RICE Scoring Formula:** RICE = (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort

**Task 1: Add clear project objective or problem statement**

* Reach: 0.5 (internal stakeholders only)
* Impact: 2 (clarifies project purpose, benefits stakeholders)
* Confidence: 9 (easy to implement, high confidence in outcome)
* Effort: 2 hours
RICE = (0.5 x 2 x 9) / 2 ≈ 4.5

**Task 2: Provide more details about the GUS BDL API and its usage**

* Reach: 1 (relevant to project, stakeholders interested in data quality)
* Impact: 3 (improves understanding of data extraction challenges)
* Confidence: 8 (moderate effort, some uncertainty about outcome)
* Effort: 5 hours
RICE = (1 x 3 x 8) / 5 ≈ 2.88

**Task 3: Elaborate on infrastructure portability and automated environment normalization**

* Reach: 0.8 (relevant to project, stakeholders interested in scalability)
* Impact: 4 (improves understanding of infrastructure design)
* Confidence: 7 (moderate effort, some uncertainty about outcome)
* Effort: 6 hours
RICE = (0.8 x 4 x 7) / 6 ≈ 2.49

**Task 4: Add visualizations or screenshots of the Power BI report**

* Reach: 1 (relevant to project, stakeholders interested in business intelligence)
* Impact: 3 (improves understanding of business outcomes)
* Confidence: 9 (easy to implement, high confidence in outcome)
* Effort: 3 hours
RICE = (1 x 3 x 9) / 3 ≈ 9

**User Ideas**

1. **Implement schema validation in PySpark**
	* Reach: 0.5 (internal stakeholders only)
	* Impact: 4 (prevents data corruption, improves data quality)
	* Confidence: 8 (moderate effort, some uncertainty about outcome)
	* Effort: 10 hours
RICE = (0.5 x 4 x 8) / 10 ≈ 1.6
2. **Add a 'What-If' parameter for inflation adjustments in the Power BI report**
	* Reach: 1 (relevant to project, stakeholders interested in business intelligence)
	* Impact: 3 (improves understanding of business outcomes)
	* Confidence: 9 (easy to implement, high confidence in outcome)
	* Effort: 5 hours
RICE = (1 x 3 x 9) / 5 ≈ 5.4
3. **Optimize Spark shuffle partitions for better local performance on large datasets**
	* Reach: 0.8 (relevant to project, stakeholders interested in scalability)
	* Impact: 5 (improves performance, reduces computational resources)
	* Confidence: 7 (moderate effort, some uncertainty about outcome)
	* Effort: 15 hours
RICE = (0.8 x 5 x 7) / 15 ≈ 2.17

Sorted backlog by RICE score:

1. **Task 4: Add visualizations or screenshots of the Power BI report** (RICE ≈ 9)
2. **User Idea 2: Add a 'What-If' parameter for inflation adjustments in the Power BI report** (RICE ≈ 5.4)
3. **Task 1: Add clear project objective or problem statement** (RICE ≈ 4.5)
4. **User Idea 1: Implement schema validation in PySpark** (RICE ≈ 1.6)
5. **Task 2: Provide more details about the GUS BDL API and its usage** (RICE ≈ 2.88)
6. **Task 3: Elaborate on infrastructure portability and automated environment normalization** (RICE ≈ 2.49)
7. **User Idea 3: Optimize Spark shuffle partitions for better local performance on large datasets** (RICE ≈ 2.17)
